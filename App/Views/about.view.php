            "silentrunning" is a PHP-based web framework I am developing based on the
            idea that object orientation is a good thing. I've built web applications
            with a few other PHP frameworks out there and wasn't satisfied with their
            philosophies.

        <h4>A Problem and a Solution</h4>
        <p>
            I've developed lots of stuff in a pretty broad set of languages and systems.
            I've written a Pascal compiler in Python and GTK+ and an OCR system with Java.
            I've worked on experimental language and IDE development as well. In all those
            things, I've come to realize that the most important aspect of easy to use
            code and systems is orthagonality. I don't like struggling with frameworks
            that force me to memorize dozens of rules and strings and arbitrary constructs
            just to get things done. PHP is an OO language. Let's use it like that.

        <h4>Sticking to what Works Best</h4>
        <p>
            Too often I've seen frameworks that try to abstract away all the database
            functionality or the HTML functionality or even Javascript in some cases.
            These tools and languages were written because they are good at what they
            do. Let's let HTML, MySQL, and Javascript do their jobs and PHP will do its
            job.
